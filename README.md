### 👋 Hi there, I'm Andrey

I'm a passionate **Android Developer** with 5+ years of professional experience in building high-quality, user-focused mobile applications using **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and modern Android architecture.

I’m currently working as a **Senior Android Developer at Posti Group**, where I lead internal enterprise Android apps, build custom libraries, and support secure mobile deployment via private Play Store.

This GitHub account is where I share **personal projects**, experiments, and ideas I work on in my free time. It's not a reflection of my full professional experience, but more of a place to tinker, learn, and build things for fun.
